### **About me**

The start of my career began when I was a university student. Then I worked in marketing, where my job was to design websites, write advertising posts, and make advertising pictures and videos. 

I graduated in quality management, where I gained skills in systematization and standardization of workflow and information.  After graduation I wrote my diploma on the subject of organization of work on external and internal quality audit. 

Working for a small merchandise sales company only reinforced my systems approach to work. There I organized the sales and merchandise accounting system. 

I believe that the personal qualities I have acquired, as well as the skills I have acquired, will help me on my way to becoming a front-end developer.
